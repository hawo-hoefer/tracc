# tracc 
A simple tracking application for on-off tracking of work periods.
I developed this to track my working hours in a quick and non-intrusive way.


## Quickstart
Install using
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:hawo-hoefer/tracc.git
$ cargo install --path .
```

## Commands 
```bash
$ tracc show  # show entries
$ tracc begin # begin work period
$ tracc end   # end work period
```

## ROADMAP
- [ ] show time spent working per day
- [ ] show diff to required working hours
- [ ] export data for visualization somehow
